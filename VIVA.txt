API stands for Application Programming Interface. It's a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs define the methods and data formats that developers can use to interact with a particular software component, service, or platform.


Model: Represents the application's data and business logic. It manages the data, responds to requests for information, and notifies views of changes in the data.
View: Represents the presentation layer of the application. It displays the data to the user and handles user interactions, such as input and output.
Controller: Acts as an intermediary between the model and the view. It receives input from the user via the view, processes it using the model, and updates the view accordingly.
