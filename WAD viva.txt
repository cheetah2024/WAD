4. What is CDN?
   CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. It is a network of distributed servers that deliver web content to users based on their geographic location. CDNs are designed to improve the performance and reliability of web content delivery by reducing latency and bandwidth usage. When a user requests a piece of content, such as an image or a script, the CDN serves it from the nearest server in its network, rather than the origin server, which can be located far away. This helps to speed up the delivery of content and improve the overall user experience.

   - `docker build`: Builds a Docker image from a Dockerfile.
   - `docker run`: Runs a Docker container from an image.
   - `docker ps`: Lists running containers.
   - `docker stop`: Stops a running container.
   - `docker push`: Pushes a Docker image to a Docker registry, such as Docker Hub.
   - `docker pull`: Pulls a Docker image from a Docker registry.


6. Explain the steps to create Docker images.
The steps to create a Docker image typically involve:
   - Writing a Dockerfile that specifies the instructions for building the image, including the base image, dependencies, environment variables, and commands to run.
   - Running the `docker build` command to build the image from the Dockerfile.
   - Tagging the image with a descriptive name using the `-t` option.
   - Optionally, pushing the image to a Docker registry using the `docker push` command to make it available to others.
